PHPShape
========

What is PHPShape?
-----------------

PHPShape is a set of PHP api's designed to ease full applications developpement. At the middle point of a toolbox and a framework, it will size to your developpement needs, providing a solid ground to build on.
The idea behind PHPShape is to provide something usefull without tiding you to a specific way of thinking, or a specific way of coding, making the hard and/or boring parts easy and secured.

Low level api's
-----------------

The fragile - and critical - point of any web application is how the data are entered, stored and presented back. So PHPShape comes with inputs handler, database abstraction layer, error management, and UTF-8 normalization.
Low level api's also includes an advanced template system (allowing many layout and image set for page output), localization, and some handy feature regarding developpement and optimizations, including sql request analysis.
All stand in sys/ directory.

High level api's
----------------

With the low level api's, you can also use an higher set of api's, designed to handle basic data quite all applications require. So a user/group management, authorizations, hierarchical tree handler, and session handler are available.
You can also benefit of a call structure, build on url?mode=whatever, object oriented, introducing a global architecture to the code, a plug-ins mechanism, and a hooking system.
All stand in api/ directory.

Flexibility
-----------

You can replace any component of PHPShape with your own, staticaly or "on the fly", extend them, or decide what to use and what not. Even low level api's can be replaced.

I hope you will enjoy playing with PHPShape tools,
